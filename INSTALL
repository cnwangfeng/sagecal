SAGECal Installation
====================
0) Prerequsites:
 - CASACORE http://casacore.googlecode.com/
 - glib http://developer.gnome.org/glib
 - BLAS/LAPACK
   Highly recommended is OpenBLAS http://www.openblas.net/
   Also, to avoid any linking issues (and to get best performance), build OpenBLAS from source and link SAGECal with the static library (libopenblas***.a) and NOT libopenblas***.so
 - Compilers gcc/g++ or Intel icc/icpc 
 - If you have NVIDIA GPUs, 
  -- CUDA/CUBLAS/CUSOLVER and nvcc
  -- NVML Nvidia management library
 - If you are using Intel Xeon Phi MICs.
  -- Intel MKL and other libraries
 - Get the source for SAGECal : git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/sagecal/code sagecal-code

1) The basic way to build is
  1.a) go to ./src/lib  and run make (which will create libsagecal.a)
  1.b) go to ./src/MS and run make (which will create the executable)


2) In ./src/lib and ./src/MS you MUST edit the Makefiles to suit your system. Some common items to edit are:
 - LAPACK: directory where LAPACK/OpenBLAS is installed
 - GLIBI/GLIBL: include/lib files for glib
 - CASA_LIBDIR/CASA_INCDIR/CASA_LIBS : casacore include/library location and files:
  Note with new CASACORE might need two include paths, e.g.
    -I/opt/casacore/include/ -I/opt/casacore/include/casacore
 - CUDAINC/CUDALIB : where CUDA/CUBLAS/CUSOLVER is installed
 - NVML_INC/NVML_LIB : NVML include/lib path
 - NVCFLAGS : flags to pass to nvcc, especially -arch option to match your GPU  
 - MKLROOT : for Intel MKL

 Example makefiles: 
   Makefile : plain build
   Makefile.gpu: with GPU support
   Note: Edit sagecal.h MAX_GPU_ID to match the number of available GPUs
   Makefile.MIC : with Intel Xeon Phi support



SAGECAL-MPI Installation
========================
0) Prerequsites:
 - Same as above 
 - MPI (e.g. OpenMPI)

1) Build ./src/lib as above (using mpicc -DMPI_BUILD)

2) Build ./src/MPI using mpicc++



BUILDSKY Installation
=====================
1) See INSTALL in ./src/buildsky


RESTORE Installation
=====================
1) See INSTALL in ./src/restore
