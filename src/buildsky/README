README file for source extraction.

=================================

1) We use 'Duchamp' and 'buildsky' for building a sky model from a FITS file. Both programs are installed at

 /software/users/lofareor/sarod/

in the cluster.

2) There are two stages in source extraction. Consider your image to be 'test.fits'
 
2.1) First, you need to run Duchamp. Take the following as a configuration file:
##########################################
imageFile test.fits
logFile         logfile.txt
outFile         results.txt
spectraFile     spectra.ps
minPix          5
flagATrous      0
snrRecon        10.
snrCut          5.
threshold 0.030
minChannels     3
flagBaseline    0
flagKarma 1
karmaFile duchamp.ann
flagnegative 0
flagMaps 0
flagOutputMask 1
flagMaskWithObjectNum 1
flagXOutput 0
############################################

You can change the 'imageFile' field to use a different FITS file. The cutoff can be changed by the 'threshold' field. The other parameters need not be changed, unless for fine tuning.

You run Duchamp as follows:

 Duchamp -p above_text_file

This will create a few more files, but what you really need from this stage is the mask file 'test.MASK.fits'

You can find more information on Duchamp from:

http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Matthew.Whiting/Duchamp/

2.2) Second, you run 'buildsky' as follows:

 buildsky -f test.fits -m test.MASK.fits


That is it. After this is over, there will be two useful files:
 
 test.fits.sky.txt : list of sources (in BBS format)
 test.fits.ds9.reg : annotation file that can be loaded using DS9
 test.fits.flux.txt: flux of each component (-d mode) with freq
 test.fits.sky.txt.cluster : clustering file
 test.fits.sky.txt.cluster.reg : clustering region for DS9


3) NOTES

3.1) You can fine tune both Duchamp and buildsky. Run the programs with -h.

3.2) Missing PSF (beam) in FITS file: 
Duchamp: use 'beamsize' (the size of the beam in pixels) in the configuration file. This value is overridden by the BMAJ, BMIN, BPA header parameters if present in the FITS file.

Run buildsky as:

   buildsky -f test.fits -m test.MASK.fits -a bmaj -b bmin -p bpa

where bmaj, bmin are the major, minor axes widths in arcseconds, bpa is the position angle in degrees.

3.3) You can tell buildsky to ignore certain pixels detected by Duchamp (such as sidelobes). Ues -g ignore_file, where ignore_file is a text file with the island numbers (one per line) to ignore.

3.4) By default, components that are closer than 1.0*beam_size are merged together to a single component. By specifying -c radius , the radius of merging can be changed. Use -c 0 to stop merging.

3.5) To cluster the sky use -k no.of.clusters as an option.
